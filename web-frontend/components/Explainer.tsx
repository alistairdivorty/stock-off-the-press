                Decision trees are a type of machine learning algorithm that
                predict a target label for previously unseen data based on
                decision rules learned during the training stage. The
                predictions of multiple decision trees are synthesised into more
                reliable predictions using a technique called gradient boosting.

                The inputs to the classifier model are text embeddings â€“ vectors
                that encode the conceptual similarity between texts through
                their location in a &quot;semantic space&quot; produced by a
                model trained on a large corpus of unlabelled data by requiring
                the model to predict masked words based on their context.
            </p>

                The model was trained on 15 years&apos; worth of historical
                data. When evaluated against a subset of the historical data,
                the model was found to achieve an accuracy rate of ~77%. The
                technology is highly experimental, and is presented here for
                demonstration purposes only.{' '}
